# X-Cash Delegated Proof of Private Stake

üó≥Ô∏è The **X-Cash Delegated Proof of Private Stake** (`xcash-dpops`) is a custom variation of a DPoS with DBFT consensus made with privacy coin from the CryptoNote legacy in mind.
The **[X-Cash](https://github.com/X-Cash-Official/xcash-core)** Public Network is governed by delegates elected by XCASH holders to secure and forge new blocks.

## Features

Implementing a **Delegated Proof of Stake** and **Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance** consensus in a privacy-based cryptocurrency presents a challenge. Taking inspiration from successful blockchain governance systems, **X-Cash Delegated Proof of Private Stake** proposes a unique solution to bring DPOS and DBFT based consensus to the privacy coin space.

### **Staking**
The **X-Cash Public Network** is secured by delegates, elected in their position by XCASH holders. By providing your **vote through a stake in XCASH**, you are electing a representative to secure the network and forge new blocks, which will in return **split the block reward with you**.

### **DBFT** 
The unique implementation of **DBFT** into the consensus process enables the X-Cash blockchain to become **immune to forks**, henceforth instantly validating new transactions.

### **Randomized Block Producer Selection**  
The selection of the next delegate in charge of forging a block is **completely randomized** through the use of **Verifiable Random Functions (VRF)**, increasing the security of the delegates by preventing attacks to the next block producer.

### **Stake Delegation with Reserve Proofs**
Instead of sending your stake to another wallet to vote toward a delegate, you are providing a **cryptographic reserver proof** of your funds to your delegate, meaning that **you keep complete control of your stake at all times**.

## Installation

> Every steps of the installation and build instructions are described in our [detailed guide](https://docs.xcash.foundation/dpops/get-started). 

### System Requirements

> In the first beta version, `xcash-dpops` will only run on a **Linux/Unix OS**. We recommend installing it on a Ubuntu VPS/dedicated server (18.04) for best compatibility.

The **recommended** system requirement is designed to be ***future-development proof***, meaning that an hardware update should never be needed and still comfortably handle the `xcash-dpops` program.
